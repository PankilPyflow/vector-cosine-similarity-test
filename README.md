# Similarity Analysis with Clean and Noisy Data

This project demonstrates the effect of noisy data on vector search similarity scores using a pre-trained Sentence Transformer model. The goal is to showcase how data preprocessing (e.g., text cleaning) impacts the retrieval relevance of text samples against specific queries.

## Files

1. **similarity_analysis_with_text.csv**
   - This CSV file contains the results of the similarity analysis.
   - The columns include:
     - `Query`: The input query related to the text samples.
     - `Sample`: The corresponding sample number.
     - `Noisy Similarity`: Cosine similarity between the query and the noisy text sample.
     - `Clean Similarity`: Cosine similarity between the query and the cleaned text sample.
     - `Difference`: The difference between the clean and noisy similarity scores.
     - `Matched Text (Noisy)`: The noisy text sample used in the analysis.
     - `Matched Text (Clean)`: The cleaned text sample used in the analysis.

2. **script.py**
   - Python script that performs the similarity analysis.
   - It loads pre-trained sentence embeddings, computes cosine similarities for both noisy and clean samples, and exports the results to a CSV file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Sentence Transformers

You can install the required Python packages by running:

```bash
pip install pandas sentence-transformers
```

## Running the Script

To run the script and generate the CSV file with similarity scores, simply execute:

```bash
python script.py
```

The resulting `similarity_analysis_with_text.csv` file will be created in the current directory.

## Objective

This analysis aims to illustrate how data cleaning can improve the relevance of text retrieval in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. By comparing noisy and clean text samples, you can observe the impact of various preprocessing techniques on similarity scores.
